# State Election Models

This repository contains code and data for analyzing and modeling state election results in Germany.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

### Main Directories
- `_auxiliary/`: Contains auxiliary files and utility functions
  - `packages.R`: R package dependencies
  - `functions.R`: Utility functions for data processing and analysis

- `data/`: Contains the input data files
  - `full_data.RData`: Complete dataset for models
  - `forecast_data.RData`: Data prepared for forecasting
  - `state-polls.csv`: Raw state polling data
  - `state-election-results.csv`: Historical state election results

- `scripts/`: Contains the main R scripts for analysis
  1. `01_estimating-models.R`: Implementation of the statistical models
  2. `02_forecast.R`: Generation of election forecasts
  3. `03_descriptives-data.R`: Descriptives for the data
  4. `04_descriptives-eval.R`: Descriptives for evaluation of model performance
  5. `05_descriptives-forecast.R`: Analysis and visualization of forecast results

- `output/`: Generated output files and results
  - `figures/`: Generated plots and visualizations
    - Various evaluation plots (MAE, RMSE, parameter estimates)
    - Polling coverage density plots
    - Forecast evaluation figures
  - `models/`: Saved model objects and results

    - Model error analyses
  - `tables/`: Generated LaTeX tables
    - Model estimation results
    - Forecast confidence intervals for different states and timeframes
  - `forecast/`: Forecast results
    - State-specific forecast data
    - Pre-registered forecast results
